## Chest X-Ray and CIFAR-10 Classification Using Deep Learning

This repository contains two image classification projects: Chest X-Ray Classification Using AI and CIFAR-10 Classification using Deep Learning.

The Chest X-Ray project uses deep learning to detect and classify chest diseases from X-ray images. The dataset consists of 133 images across four classes: Healthy, Covid-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia.

The CIFAR-10 project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into ten classes. The dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images across various categories.

Both projects utilize deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks, and provide instructions for training, evaluation, and future improvements.

In conclusion, these projects showcase the application of deep learning for accurate image classification and provide a foundation for further advancements in computer vision.
