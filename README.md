**Chest X-Ray Classification Using AI**

This project aims to utilize a deep learning model to detect and classify chest diseases from X-ray images. The primary objective is to accurately identify and categorize the presence of different conditions, including Healthy, Covid-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, and Viral Pneumonia.Chest X-Ray Classification Using AI project aims to provide an automated approach for detecting and classifying chest diseases from X-ray images. By leveraging deep learning techniques, it offers the potential to assist healthcare professionals in making accurate.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project consists of 133 chest X-ray images. These images are categorized into four classes:
Healthy: Images of chest X-rays show no signs of any respiratory disease.
Covid-19: Images of chest X-rays from patients diagnosed with Covid-19.
Bacterial Pneumonia: Images of chest X-rays from patients diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.
Viral Pneumonia: Images of chest X-rays from patients diagnosed with viral pneumonia.
Medical professionals carefully curate and label the dataset to ensure accurate classification and reliable deep-learning model training.

**Model Architecture**

The deep learning model utilized in this project is designed to learn and recognize patterns within chest X-ray images. It leverages convolutional neural network (CNN) techniques to extract relevant image features, enabling accurate classification.
The model architecture incorporates multiple layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. These layers work together to capture and learn the intricate patterns indicative of different chest diseases.


**Results**

The performance of the deep learning model can be evaluated based on the accuracy achieved during the evaluation step. Additionally, it is recommended to analyze precision, recall, and F1-score for each class to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses in differentiating between various chest diseases.

**Future Improvements**

While the current implementation provides a baseline for chest X-ray classification, there are several potential areas for future improvement:
Increase the dataset size: A more extensive dataset can provide more diverse examples and enhance the model's ability to generalize.
Fine-tune the model: Experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters, and optimization algorithms to improve model performance.
Incorporate transfer learning: Utilize pre-trained models, such as those trained on ImageNet, and fine-tune them on the chest X-ray dataset to leverage their learned features.
Enhance data augmentation: Explore advanced techniques to generate additional training samples and reduce overfitting.
Explore ensemble methods: Investigate ensemble methods, such as model averaging or stacking, to further boost classification accuracy.
